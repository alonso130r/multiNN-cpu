# gpt-cpp
A C++ implementation of my previous Transformer LLM (No ML libraries used)
(Also includes all miniprojects I made in order to learn how to do the implementation)

## Branches Description (multi-class NN):
main: basic version with no real performance additions
AdamW: AdamW weight updating, converges better then main, can be slow to train
AdamW+Batches: AdamW weight updating with batch based training, incomplete
